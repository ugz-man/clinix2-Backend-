## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## üéØ Objective

This app provides easy access to personalized health information, eliminating the constant wait for doctor‚Äôs appointments or the need to reach out for answers to personal health questions. Whether you're seeking quick insights or general guidance, the app offers helpful support. However, for serious concerns or confirmation, it's always recommended to consult a medical professional. This app serves everyone and can be used by anyone.

For simple concerns like leg pain, headaches, or more private matters you may not feel comfortable discussing‚Äîsuch as wet dreams‚Äîthis app offers access to information. It helps you understand potential causes, track patterns, and explore possible ways to manage or alleviate the symptoms just by asking questions.

_([x/Twitter](https://x.com/ugz_man))_

### Your Approach:

- I chose this problem as this was something I could relate with in my life.
- Some of the Challenges faced were: working with images, understaing prompting of LLMs, App Architecture, among others.
- One breakthrough I recall was when I was able to structure the messages array to accomodate both messages with text only and an image link and text.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:

- Node.js | MongoDB
- API Keys: Groq API Key
- .env file setup: create a `config.env` file

### Local Setup:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ugz-man/clinix2-Backend-.git

# Install dependencies
cd clinix2-Backend-
npm install

# Start up MongoDB server
mongod

# Open a new tab in your terminal
# Start development server
node server.js
```

You'll need to create the following variables in your `config.env` file:

- `NODE_ENV`: The environment you are running the Nodejs app from, the value should be development
- `DATABASE`: The url to the mogodb instance locally running on your system e.g mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/clinix2
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: An API key from Groq so as to use their services
